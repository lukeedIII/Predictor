## 🔬 About

I build **institutional-grade quantitative intelligence systems** for cryptocurrency markets. My work focuses on ensemble machine learning, real-time signal processing, and deploying production-ready AI — all running locally on consumer hardware.

My flagship project, **Nexus Shadow-Quant**, is a 16-model ensemble engine that processes 42 scale-invariant features across multiple timeframes, delivering statistically significant alpha with a positive Sharpe ratio on 3.15M+ candles.

## 📊 Flagship: Nexus Shadow-Quant

> A 6-year high-resolution crypto forecasting engine with a 16-model quant diagnostic panel.

- ✅ **50.71% accuracy** on 105,031-prediction audit (3.15M candles)
- ✅ **0.88 Sharpe ratio** — the ONLY positive Sharpe in the test universe
- ✅ **42 scale-invariant features** (returns, z-scores, ratios — no raw prices)
- ✅ **Champion-Challenger deployment** with drift monitoring (PSI + calibration)
- ✅ **Fee-adjusted net-PnL** (taker 0.04% + slippage 0.01%)
- ✅ Runs 100% locally on a single RTX GPU
